# whoopBlast
This project aims to discover correlations between data collected by Whoop (i.e. sleep/recovery scores) and data collected by Blast sensors (i.e. bat speed)

## Future Plans
This spring, I plan to capture more data with my Blast during my college season. I hope to be able to capture swing data daily at practices (and possibly games?).
This will ensure that I have a sufficient amount of data to receive consistent patterns.

I plan to write up a report on which health variables impact swing metrics the most.
